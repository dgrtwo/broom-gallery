Here's one snippet to get you started.

* To edit this snippet, open `_R/example-snippet.Rmd` (or add new snippets in that folder!).
* To rebuild it, use the [rgallery](https://github.com/dgrtwo/rgallery) package, with the `build_gallery()` function.
* To view the page, go to the command line and do:

    jekyll serve --watch    

These snippets work just like any [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) page. You can perform operations:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

And you can make a graph (which will pop up as a "teaser" on the main gallery page):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
