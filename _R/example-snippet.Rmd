Here's one snippet to get you started. Note that you can find this snippet in `_R/example-snippet.Rmd`. To build it, use the [rgallery](https://github.com/dgrtwo/rgallery) package, with the `build_gallery()` function.

These snippets work just like any [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) page. You can perform operations:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

And you can make a graph (which will pop up as a "teaser" on the main gallery page):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
