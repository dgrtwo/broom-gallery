# Default gallery setup for rgallery

This is the default gallery setup suggested for the [rgallery](https://github.com/dgrtwo/rgallery) package. It is a variation on the [Skinny Bones Jekyll Theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/skinny-bones-jekyll/) by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/).

To set up your page, you'll need [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [rgallery](https://github.com/dgrtwo/rgallery) installed.
